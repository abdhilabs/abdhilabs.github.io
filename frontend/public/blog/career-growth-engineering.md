After five years in the industry, I've been reflecting on what "senior" really means and how to keep growing.

## Beyond Code

Seniority isn't just about writing better code. It's about:

- **Mentoring others**: Helping junior developers grow
- **Making technical decisions**: Choosing the right tool for the job
- **Communicating effectively**: Translating technical concepts for stakeholders
- **Understanding business context**: Knowing why we build what we build

## Continuous Learning

The tech industry moves fast. I dedicate time each week to:

- Reading technical papers and blog posts
- Experimenting with new technologies
- Contributing to open source
- Attending conferences and meetups

## Finding Your Path

There's no single path to growth. Some engineers become managers, others go deep technically. The key is intentionality—know what you want and work toward it.

## My Principles

1. Always be learning
2. Share knowledge freely
3. Seek feedback actively
4. Build relationships across teams
5. Focus on impact, not just output

The journey continues. Every day is an opportunity to grow.
